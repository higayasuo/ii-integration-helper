# II Integration Helper

A TypeScript library that provides helper functions for implementing the Proxy Web App component of Internet Identity (II) integration for mobile applications. This library follows the secure integration pattern described in the [Internet Computer documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/security/iam#integrating-internet-identity-on-mobile-devices).

## Overview

This library implements the Proxy Web App component of the secure Internet Identity integration pattern for mobile applications. It helps create a secure bridge between mobile applications and Internet Identity by:

1. Generating an intermediate session key
2. Initiating the II client authentication protocol using this intermediate key
3. Creating a delegation chain that allows the mobile application to use their session key
4. Returning the delegation chain to the mobile app using app links/universal links and URI fragments

This approach prevents delegation theft attacks that could occur with naive implementations.

## Installation

```bash
npm install ii-integration-helper
```

## Dependencies

### Peer Dependencies

These dependencies need to be installed in your project:

```bash
npm install @dfinity/agent @dfinity/identity @dfinity/auth-client
```

- `@dfinity/agent`: For Internet Computer agent functionality
- `@dfinity/identity`: For identity and delegation management
- `@dfinity/auth-client`: For authentication client functionality

### Regular Dependencies

The following dependencies are included in the package:

- `canister-manager`: For canister URL management

## Features

- Secure Internet Identity authentication integration for mobile applications
- Intermediate session key generation and management
- Delegation chain creation and verification
- Deep linking support for various platforms (ICP, Expo, native apps)
- Public key handling
- Error formatting and rendering
- Button setup and event handling

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import {
  buildParams,
  setupLoginButtonHandler,
  prepareButtons,
} from 'ii-integration-helper';

// Build parameters for II integration
const params = buildParams({
  localIPAddress: '127.0.0.1',
  dfxNetwork: 'local',
  internetIdentityCanisterId: 'rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai',
  frontendCanisterId: 'rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai',
  expoScheme: 'myapp',
  window: window,
});

// Prepare buttons
const { iiLoginButton, backToAppButton } = prepareButtons();

// Setup login button handler
await setupLoginButtonHandler({
  iiLoginButton,
  backToAppButton,
  deepLink: params.deepLink,
  appPublicKey: params.appPublicKey,
  iiUri: params.iiUri,
  window: window,
});
```

### Deep Linking

```typescript
import { buildDeepLink, DeepLinkType } from 'ii-integration-helper';

// Build a deep link for different platforms
const deepLink = buildDeepLink({
  deepLinkType: 'icp' as DeepLinkType,
  localIPAddress: '127.0.0.1',
  dfxNetwork: 'local',
  frontendCanisterId: 'rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai',
  expoScheme: 'myapp',
});
```

### Delegation Chain

```typescript
import {
  buildMiddleToAppDelegationChain,
  buildURIFragment,
} from 'ii-integration-helper';

// Build a delegation chain
const delegationChain = await buildMiddleToAppDelegationChain({
  middleDelegationIdentity,
  appPublicKey,
  expiration: new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 15), // 15 minutes
});

// Build a URI fragment for the delegation
const uriFragment = buildURIFragment(delegationChain);
```

## Security Considerations

This library implements the secure integration pattern for Internet Identity on mobile devices as described in the [Internet Computer documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/security/iam#integrating-internet-identity-on-mobile-devices). Key security features include:

1. **Intermediate Session Key**: The library generates an intermediate session key that is stored by the web app proxy frontend, preventing delegation theft.

2. **Delegation Chain**: The library creates a delegation chain consisting of two delegations:

   - First delegation: From the II canister key to the intermediate key (generated by the II canister)
   - Second delegation: From the intermediate key to the mobile app public key (signed by the proxy frontend)

3. **Secure Communication**: The delegation chain is returned to the mobile app using app links/universal links and URI fragments, which prevents delegation leakage.

4. **Origin Verification**: The library helps verify the origin of authentication requests to prevent phishing attacks.

## API Reference
